## Usage
This repository contains a password generator webpage, which can be viewed on a variety of devices as it has been configured for multiple screen dimensions. Upon clicking the "Generate Password" button, the user must input a whole number value from 8 to 128 to establish the length of the generated password. If an invalid value is entered, the user will be prompted to enter an appropriate value. The user must then chose between four sets of characters to be included in the generated password. If no character set is chosen, the user will be prompted that at least one option must be chosen and will be presented with the options again. Once valid options have been selected, a new password will be generated that meets the selected criteria.
